                        <p>Despite being tested with severe illness and loss of wealth and family, Prophet Ayyub remained patient and faithful to Allah. His story teaches us the virtue of patience during hardships.</p>
                        <p>For years, he suffered from a painful skin disease that made people avoid him. Yet he never complained against Allah's decree. He continuously prayed: "Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful." (Quran 21:83)</p>
                        <p>Allah eventually healed him and restored his wealth and family, showing that patience through trials leads to great reward.</p>

                        <p>As he was being catapulted into the flames, Angel Jibreel appeared to him and asked if he needed help. Ibrahim replied: "If Allah knows about my situation, that is sufficient for me."</p>
                        <p>Allah then said: "O fire, be coolness and safety upon Ibrahim." (Quran 21:69) The fire immediately lost its heat, and Ibrahim emerged unharmed, strengthening the faith of believers for generations to come.</p>

                        <p>After suffering this terrible treatment, the Prophet made a humble dua: "O Allah, I complain to You of my weakness, my scarcity of resources and the humiliation I have been subjected to by the people. O Most Merciful of those who are merciful. O Lord of the weak and my Lord too. To whom have you entrusted me?"</p>
                        <p>He then added: "So long as You are not angry with me, I do not care. Your favor is of a more expansive relief to me. I seek refuge in the light of Your Countenance by which all darkness is dispelled and every affair of this world and the next is set right, lest Your anger should descend upon me or Your displeasure light upon me. I need only Your pleasure and satisfaction for only You enable me to do good and avoid evil."</p>

                    <div class="short-content">
                    A long time ago, in the land of Babylon, there lived a young boy named Ibrahim (عليه السلام). ..                    </div>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>He grew up in a place where people made idols from stone and wood, and then they worshiped them. Even his own father used to carve these idols.But Ibrahim (A.S.) was very wise from a young age. He asked his father:
"Yā Abati (O my dear father), why do you worship things that cannot hear, see, or help you?"

The people did not like his questions. They said, "We follow our fathers and forefathers."</p>
                        <p>One day, Ibrahim (A.S.) decided to show them the truth. He broke all the idols in the temple except the biggest one. When the people came, they were shocked. They asked, "Who has done this to our gods?"

Ibrahim (A.S.) said, "Ask the big idol, maybe it did this!" The people became angry, because they knew idols cannot speak. But instead of believing the truth, they planned to punish him.

They built a huge fire, the biggest fire people had ever seen. They tied Ibrahim (A.S.) and threw him into the flames. But Allah ﷻ ordered:  (“O Fire, be coolness and peace upon Ibrahim”).</p>
                        <p>The fire became cool, and Ibrahim (A.S.) walked out safely. The people were amazed. Allah had protected His Prophet.</p>
                        <p>From that day, many people started believing in the One true God, Allāh, and Ibrahim (A.S.) continued his mission to guide humanity.</p>

                        <p>When she declared her faith, Pharaoh tortured her brutally, but she never renounced her belief. During her torture, she prayed: "My Lord, build for me near You a house in Paradise and save me from Pharaoh and his deeds and save me from the wrongdoing people." (Quran 66:11)</p>
                        <p>Allah answered her prayer, and she died as a martyr. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) mentioned her as one of the four perfected women in Islam, alongside Maryam, Khadijah, and Fatimah.</p>

                        <p>He also taught: "O my son, indeed if it [a deed] should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Aware." (Quran 31:16)</p>
                        <p>Luqman advised his son to establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient with what befalls him. He also counseled him against arrogance: "And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly. Indeed, Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful." (Quran 31:18)</p>
