                        <p>Despite being tested with severe illness and loss of wealth and family, Prophet Ayyub remained patient and faithful to Allah. His story teaches us the virtue of patience during hardships.</p>
                        <p>For years, he suffered from a painful skin disease that made people avoid him. Yet he never complained against Allah's decree. He continuously prayed: "Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful." (Quran 21:83)</p>
                        <p>Allah eventually healed him and restored his wealth and family, showing that patience through trials leads to great reward.</p>

                        <p>When Prophet Ibrahim was thrown into the fire by his people, he placed his complete trust in Allah, who commanded the fire to be cool and safe for him. This story shows the power of tawakkul (reliance on Allah).</p>
                        <p>As he was being catapulted into the flames, Angel Jibreel appeared to him and asked if he needed help. Ibrahim replied: "If Allah knows about my situation, that is sufficient for me."</p>
                        <p>Allah then said: "O fire, be coolness and safety upon Ibrahim." (Quran 21:69) The fire immediately lost its heat, and Ibrahim emerged unharmed, strengthening the faith of believers for generations to come.</p>

                        <p>After suffering this terrible treatment, the Prophet made a humble dua: "O Allah, I complain to You of my weakness, my scarcity of resources and the humiliation I have been subjected to by the people. O Most Merciful of those who are merciful. O Lord of the weak and my Lord too. To whom have you entrusted me?"</p>
                        <p>He then added: "So long as You are not angry with me, I do not care. Your favor is of a more expansive relief to me. I seek refuge in the light of Your Countenance by which all darkness is dispelled and every affair of this world and the next is set right, lest Your anger should descend upon me or Your displeasure light upon me. I need only Your pleasure and satisfaction for only You enable me to do good and avoid evil."</p>

                        <p>Despite being betrayed by his brothers, sold into slavery, and imprisoned unjustly, Prophet Yusuf remained honest and trustworthy throughout his trials.</p>
                        <p>When he was in charge of Egypt's food storage during seven years of famine, he could have easily taken advantage of his position. Instead, he meticulously measured and distributed the grain with perfect honesty.</p>
                        <p>When his brothers came to Egypt seeking food, he tested them and eventually revealed his identity, saying: "No blame will there be upon you today. Allah will forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful." (Quran 12:92)</p>
                        <p>His story demonstrates that honesty and integrity in all circumstances lead to Allah's reward and eventual victory.</p>

                        <p>Asiyah, the wife of the tyrant Pharaoh, secretly believed in Allah despite living in the palace of the greatest enemy of God. Her story is one of incredible courage and faith.</p>
                        <p>When she declared her faith, Pharaoh tortured her brutally, but she never renounced her belief. During her torture, she prayed: "My Lord, build for me near You a house in Paradise and save me from Pharaoh and his deeds and save me from the wrongdoing people." (Quran 66:11)</p>
                        <p>Allah answered her prayer, and she died as a martyr. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) mentioned her as one of the four perfected women in Islam, alongside Maryam, Khadijah, and Fatimah.</p>

                        <p>Among his advice was: "O my son, do not associate [anything] with Allah. Indeed, association [with him] is great injustice." (Quran 31:13)</p>
                        <p>He also taught: "O my son, indeed if it [a deed] should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Aware." (Quran 31:16)</p>
                        <p>Luqman advised his son to establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient with what befalls him. He also counseled him against arrogance: "And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly. Indeed, Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful." (Quran 31:18)</p>
