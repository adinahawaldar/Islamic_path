                    <h3>🌙 Story of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ – The Light for Humanity</h3>
                    <div class="short-content">
                        Despite being tested with severe illness and loss of wealth and family, Prophet Ayyub remained patient and faithful to Allah...
                    </div>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>From his early life, Muhammad ﷺ was known as Al-Ameen (the Trustworthy) because he was always honest, kind, and caring.<br>

                              At the age of 40, in the Cave of Hira, Angel Jibreel عليه السلام brought him the first revelation: “Read in the name of your Lord who created.” This moment changed the world forever. He was chosen by Allah to guide humanity out of darkness.</p>
                        <p>His mission was not easy. People mocked him, threw stones, and even forced him to leave his beloved city Makkah. Yet, he never gave up. He forgave his enemies, cared for the poor, smiled at the orphans, and taught people that the best among us are those with the best character.<br>

After years of struggle, Islam spread across Arabia. But Prophet ﷺ never became arrogant. He lived simply sleeping on a mat, mending his own clothes, eating dates and bread even when he was the leader of an entire nation.<br><br>
His message was clear: Worship Allah alone, be kind to others, and live with justice and mercy.</p>
<br>
                        <p>Today, more than 1400 years later, his light still guides us. Every time we follow his sunnah, speak kindly, give charity, or pray sincerely, we walk on the path he showed the path that leads to Jannah.</p>

                    <h3>🔥 Prophet Ibrahim عليه السلام and the Fire</h3>
                    <div class="short-content">
                        Prophet Ibrahim عليه السلام was a very kind and honest man. From a young age, he loved Allah and knew that idols could not hear, see, or help anyone...
                    </div>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>He often tried to guide his people, telling them to worship only Allah instead of the idols they made.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The people did not like this. They became very angry because Ibrahim عليه السلام was showing them the truth. One day, they decided to punish him. They tied him up and threw him into a huge fire. The flames were very high, and it looked impossible for anyone to survive.</p>
                        <p>But Allah is the Most Powerful and Merciful. He sent His angels to protect Prophet Ibrahim عليه السلام, and the fire became cool and safe. Ibrahim عليه السلام walked out of the fire without even a single burn! The people were shocked to see this miracle.</p>

                        <p>This story teaches us many important lessons:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Always trust Allah, even when facing difficulties. </li>
                                <li>Standing for truth and righteousness is never wrong. </li>
                                 <li>Allah’s help comes to those who are patient and sincere. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Even today, Muslims remember Prophet Ibrahim عليه السلام for his courage, faith, and love for Allah. His life inspires us to stay firm in our faith, no matter how hard the challenges are.

                    <h3>🌿 The Wisdom of Luqman الحكيم</h3>
                    <div class="short-content">
                        Luqman الحكيم was a wise and kind man, known for his deep understanding and good advice...
                    </div>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>People from near and far came to listen to his words because everything he said taught them how to live a good and peaceful life.</p>
                        <p>Even though Luqman was not a prophet, Allah had blessed him with great wisdom. He knew how to guide people gently and how to solve problems in a fair way. Luqman had a son, and he wanted to teach him the most important lessons of life so that he would grow up to be a good, faithful, and responsible person.</p>
<br>

<p>He told his son many wise things, such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>“Do not associate anyone with Allah.” Always worship Allah alone and never forget Him. </li>
                                <li>“Be kind to your parents.” Even if they are strict or make mistakes, respect and love them. </li>
                                 <li>“Be mindful of your actions.” Speak good words, avoid lying, and treat others fairly. </li>

                                 <li>“Be humble.” Pride and arrogance will make life difficult. </li>

                                 <li>“Be patient.” Hard times will come, but patience brings peace and Allah’s reward. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Luqman also taught that even the smallest act of goodness is valuable, and that true wisdom comes from understanding life and obeying Allah. His advice reminds us to think, reflect, and make choices that bring us closer to Allah. <br> The story of Luqman الحكيم inspires everyone to seek wisdom, act kindly, and live a life full of faith, patience, and gratitude.</p>

                    <h3> 🌟 The Patience of Prophet Ayyub (Job عليه السلام)</h3>
                    <div class="short-content">
                    Prophet Ayyub (عليه السلام) was a man blessed with wealth, family, and good health. He loved Allah very much and was grateful for everything he had...              
                    </div>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>But Allah tested him in a way that showed the strength of his faith.</p>
                        <p>One by one, Ayyub lost his wealth, his children passed away, and he became very sick. His skin was covered with sores, and people avoided him because of his condition. Despite all these hardships, Ayyub never complained or lost faith in Allah. He prayed constantly, saying, “Indeed, adversity has touched me, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”.</p>
                        <p>After many years of patience and prayer, Allah rewarded Ayyub. His health was restored, his family and wealth were returned, and he became even closer to Allah.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Lesson: True faith is shown not only in happiness but also in patience during hardships.</p>

                    <h3>🌟 The Faith of Asiyah (رضي الله عنها)</h3>
                    <div class="short-content">
Asiyah was the wife of the Pharaoh, one of the most powerful and cruel rulers in Egypt. Despite living in a palace full of wealth, luxury, and authority, she had a heart that longed for truth and guidance...                    </div>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>She secretly believed in Allah and followed the message of Prophet Musa (عليه السلام).</p>
                        <p>The Pharaoh was harsh and cruel, forcing people to worship him instead of Allah. But Asiyah refused to obey him in matters of faith. She built a small place in her palace to worship Allah alone, praying quietly and reading the signs of Allah in creation.</p>
                        <p>When the Pharaoh discovered her faith, he was furious. He tried to punish her, threatening her with severe torture. Yet, Asiyah remained strong and patient, saying, “My Lord, build for me a house in Paradise and save me from Pharaoh and his deeds, and save me from the wrongdoing people.”</p>
                        <p>Despite being in the most dangerous situation, she never gave up her faith. Allah honored her courage and devotion, and she is remembered as one of the greatest women in Islam for her unwavering belief.</p><br>
                        <p>Lesson: True faith does not depend on power, wealth, or comfort. Even in the most difficult circumstances, trusting Allah and holding firm to belief can earn eternal reward.</p>

                    <h3>🌟 The Courage of Prophet Musa (Moses عليه السلام)</h3>

Prophet Musa (عليه السلام) was born during a time when the Pharaoh ruled Egypt and oppressed the people. The Pharaoh ordered that all newborn boys of the Israelites be killed...                    </div>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>Musa’s mother, trusting Allah, placed him in a basket and set it afloat in the river. Allah protected him, and he was found by the Pharaoh’s family and raised in the palace.</p>
                        <p>As he grew older, Musa saw the suffering of his people. He faced many challenges, including confronting the Pharaoh, performing miracles, and leading his people out of slavery. Despite fear and danger, Musa always relied on Allah’s guidance.</p>
<br>
                        <p>Lesson: Courage and faith can overcome the greatest of oppressions. Allah always helps those who trust Him.</p>
